It wil show error "cannot fetch user ID" because for now, it did not link to the whole progress, so i cannot get local user id. If you want to test it. you should first integrate with current system, and log in with an user id to test it. 

But i have directly change user id  to a 12345 to test it, it works. So when you connect it with system, it should work.
